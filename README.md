# HWIDLicenseServer
A hardware-id-based licensing server.
I'm publishing this pretty much because I'm not using this for any of my projects anymore and there are multiple improvements that this could use, some are listed below.

## ToDo
- Cleanup the code
- Improve code architecture
- Replace the constant symmetric encryption with SSL to secure the socket communication properly
- Implement more features to help handle user edge cases

### Note!
This is an old project of mine so if you are going to use this for a production application
I'd recommend going over the code since there are multiple changes I would do beforehand.
